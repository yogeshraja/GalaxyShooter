# GalaxyShooter
The vintage game that we all grew up playing is recreated using python's pygame library
* Use the `Right` `Left` `Up` `Down` arrow keys to control the space ship
* Combine the arrow keys to move `diagonally`
* If the game is over `Right click` inside the screen to restart the game
* To exit the game press `Esc`
